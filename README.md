# Description
This project was worked on throughout the semester. Two classes (System Analysis & Design/Database Fundamentals) shared a case study and the same 4 person group is used. 
We were tasked to create a new booking system for a venue. We used Wix for our website prototype and created a relational database with oracle. The final reports for each class are included within the repo.
